This project explores and visualizes diabetes-related health data to identify key patterns and trends.
While the original dataset was sourced externally, all data transformation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization work were performed by me.

Pivot Tables: Created pivot summaries to compare metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and age groups.
